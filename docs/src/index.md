# **Welcome to MyCivitas**

Overview

MyCivitas is a user-friendly, cost-effective asset management platform designed specifically for smaller, budget-conscious municipalities.  Leveraging GIS technology, it seamlessly caters to both the strategic planning and day-to-day operational requirements of asset management.

Users can view, locate and query their asset inventory data. MyCivitas calculates and reports Asset Management related information including the condition, replacement cost, life expectancy, probability of failure, consequence of failure and associated risk related to assets.  MyCivitas also includes a Computerized Maintenance Management Software (CMMS) module to create and manage work orders.

MyCivitas uses QGIS, a free open-source desktop GIS and is integrated with Mergin Maps for recording information on site using a mobile app.

<!-- ### Purpose -->

## Where to start

We recommend the following three-step approach: 

![Scope](./img/scope-1.png)

LandInfo developed a three-step methodology to support smaller communities in the development of their asset management plans:

## Step 1: Asset Register

Assets are captured in MyCivitasâ€™s predefined data structure using QGIS.  Typically, data is obtained from existing electronic data, hard-copy maps and reports. The remaining unknown assets are recorded through field surveys using Mergin Maps, an open-source mobile application.

Once the data is captured, MyCivitas is used to generate reports on the condition, life expectancy, replacement cost, etc. of assets. The goal is to answer the following asset management questions:

- What do we own?

- Where is it?

- What is the condition?

- What is the remaining life?

- What is the replacement value?

## Step 2: Asset Prioritization

The second phase is prioritizing assets based on risk. This phase is intended to identify critical assets. The probability of failure and consequence of failure values are collected for all assets. The goal is to answer the following Asset Management questions: 

- What assets are the high priority?

- What assets need to be replaced first?

## Step 3: Capital and Operational Strategies

Focusing on the high-priority assets identified in Step 2, the next step is to develop capital and operational strategies. A primary focus is to implement operational procedures to extend the life of assets and risk mitigation.

MyCivitas automatically calculates renewal costs as well as the anticipated maintenance costs and annual averaged infrastructure demand requirements.
